> Pentagonal numbers are generated by the formula, $P_n=n(3n-1)/2$. The first ten pentagonal numbers are:
> $$1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51, 70, 92, 117, 145, \dots$$
> It can be seen that $P_4 + P_7 = 22 + 70 = 92 = P_8$. However, their difference, $70 - 22 = 48$, is not pentagonal.
> Find the pair of pentagonal numbers, $P_j$ and $P_k$, for which their sum and difference are pentagonal and $D = |P_k - P_j|$ is minimised; what is the value of $D$?


- I do not see any interesting properties of pentagonal numbers, we can use.
- Distances between pentagonal numbers only grow, the first hit should therefore be the smallest if we just start from the smallest.
- I have written a simple static method Polygonals to check for and generate arbitrary n-gonals.
```
for k
	for j < k
		(return first hit for P_j,P_k with wanted properties)
```
